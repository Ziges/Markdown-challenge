## A funny story 
A friends' dad once invited me over for lunch to try one of his famous homemade Thai style papaya salads (som tam pet pet). Little did I know that he had laced it with super spicy & hot chilli peppers. 
I instantly turned red as a tomato and started to sweat all over, tears were streaming down my face and my mouth was on fire for at least 15 mins. 
Never trust your friends' dad's cooking. 

#### TL;DR...or...Too long; Didn't read 
Don't eat Thai papaya salad if you can't handle spicy food!
